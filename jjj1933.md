# Johnston

## Grandparents

### John Johnston (1908-1989) and Winifred Burns (1910-1957)

- [marriage certificate](1932_marriage_john_johnston_winifred_burns.pdf)
- [JJ birth certificate](1908_birth_john_johnston.pdf)
- [JJ death certificate](1989_death_john_johnston.pdf)
- [WB birth certificate](1910_birth_winifred_burns.pdf)
- [WB baptism](1910_baptism_winifred_burns.pdf)
- [WB death certificate](1957_death_winifred_burns.pdf)

The [1911 census](1911_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.pdf) shows Winifred as 7 months old living in "Kinglassie Factory Place Private Houses" with her parents and older siblings. Later censuses are not available online. Her god parents are listed as Michael McDonough and (unreadable).

Marriage witnesses are Robert Johnston (3 Hamilton Street, Lochgelly) and Lily Burns (19 Colliery Cottages, Kinglassie - differs from Winifred Burns' address of 19 Pit Rows, Kinglassie). Winifred is named as witness to the [marriage of her sister](1927_marriage_dora_florence.pdf) Dora Florence and listed under the address Rolleston, East Newport (possibly this [house](https://www.newportarchive.co.uk/property.php?ID=26200).

## Great-grandparents

### Edward Byrne/Burns (c.1871-1932) and Jane/Janey Butler (c.1878-1925)

- [marriage certificate](1901_marriage_edward_byrne_burns_jane_butler.pdf)
- [catholic register](1901_catholic_register_edward_byrne_jane_butler.pdf)
- [1901 census](1901_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.jpg)
- [1911 census](1911_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.pdf)
- [EB death certificate](1932_death_edward_byrne.pdf)
- [JB death certificate](1925_death_jane_butler.pdf)


"Byrne" was anglicized as "Burns", which made Edward very difficult to trace. His parents (Bridget Mulhall and Michael Byrne) [married in Ireland](1869_marriage_michael_byrne_bridget_mulhall.pdf) and worked in Cumberland, where Edward Byrne was born (see [1911 census](1911_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.pdf)). Michael Byrne died at some point before the [1901 census](1901_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.jpg) which shows Edward living in Auchterderran as a lodger with his mother, stepfather James Ryan, and future wife Jane Butler (listed as a boarder). Jane Butler's place of birth is listed only as "England". First part of Butler residence on marriage certificate unclear. Possibly “Frizington, Cumberland”. No record of parents marriage in Ireland or Scotland. Her mother’s given name differs between her marriage and death certificates (Ann/Jane). Confident that I have correct death certificate because it is from Leslie and the address of Edward Burns  is listed as “14(?) Prinlaws” (Part of Leslie). This agrees with [Mary Helen’s death certificate](1926_death_mary_helen_burns.pdf) which lists Jane as deceased and the address as 146 North Street, Prinlaws. Mother’s maiden name is “Dowling” on marriage certificate but possibly “Dollan” on death certificate (possibly Irish). When she herself registered births (see [Dora Florence Burns](1928_birth_dora_florence_burns.pdf) and [Mary Helen Burns](1907_birth_mary_helen_burns.jpg)), her name is given as "Janey".

### Patrick Johnston (1872-1955) and Catherine Campbell (c.1877-1924)

- [marriage certificate](1872_marriage_william_johnston_catherine_campbell.pdf)
- [1891 census (PJ)](1891_census_william_johnston_ann_jane_mccaig.pdf)
- [1901 census](1901_census_patrick_catherine_william_johnston.pdf)
- [1911 census part 1](1911_census_patrick_johnston_catherine_campbell_part1.pdf)
- [1911 census part 2](1911_census_patrick_johnston_catherine_campbell_part2.pdf)
- [PJ birth certificate](1872_birth_patrick_johnston.pdf) (Irish)
- [PJ death certificate](1955_death_patrick_johnston.pdf)
- [PJ death correction](1955_death_patrick_johnston_correction.pdf)
- [CC death certificate](1924_death_catherine_johnston.pdf)

Patrick and his siblings are listed on various censuses as Irish born. The [1911 census of his elderly parents](1911_census_william_johnston_ann_jane_mckeag.pdf) lists their marriage as having produced 6 children with 4 still living. Haven't been able to find the two that were dead as of 1911. Patrick and Catherine seem to have moved to Fife where John Johnston was born in Lochgelly before moving to Uphall. It seems that they lived in the [Niddry Rows](https://www.scottishshale.co.uk/places/company-housing/niddry-rows/) (housing for Hopetoun Oil workers, demolished c. 1935) at Kirkliston, which is recorded as Winchburgh on some certificates. A couple of generations of Catherine’s family died in Niddry Rows (her father Samuel Campbell and his mother Catherine)

Censuses list Catherine Campbell as born in Bailieston but her name is too common at the time to be able to find the birth certificate.

## Second great-grandparents

### Michael Byrne and Bridget Mulhall (c1846-1941)

- [marriage certificate](1869_marriage_michael_byrne_bridget_mulhall.pdf)
- [1901 census (BM)](1(1911_census_john_fernie_janet_dobbie.pdf)901_census_edward_byrne_jane_butler.jpg)
- [BM death certificate](1941_death_bridget_mulhall.pdf)

Bridget Mulhall's death certificate only lists Michael Byrne (not James Ryan although both marriages are noted on her son [Edward's death certificate](1932_death_edward_byrne.pdf). The informant on her death certificate is a governor (rather than a family member) but a residence in Lochgelly is listed in addition to the place of death (Dunfermline). She would have lived at the same time as many of her great grandchildren.

### Thomas Butler and Jane Dowling

No records.

### Samuel Campbell (c.1848-1905) and Elizabeth McCaig (c.1852-1937)

- [marriage certificate](1873_marriage_samuel_campbell_elizabeth_mccaig.pdf)
- [1881 census](1881_census_samuel_campbell_elizabeth_mccaig.pdf)
- [SC death certificate](1905_death_samuel_campbell.pdf)
- [EM death certificate](1937_death_elizabeth_mccaig.pdf)

Elizabeth's death certificate records her address as Lochgelly. Similar to Bridget Mulhall, she would have lived to see some of her great grandchildren.

### William Johnston (c.1847-1920) and Ann Jane McKeag/McCaig (c.1852-1923)

Possibly married in Ireland

- [1891 census](1891_census_william_johnston_ann_jane_mccaig.pdf)
- [1901 census](1901_census_william_johnston_ann_jane_mccaig.pdf)
- [1911 census](1911_census_william_johnston_ann_jane_family.pdf)
- [WJ death certificate](1920_death_william_johnston.pdf)
- [AJM death certificate](1923_death_ann_jane_mccaig.pdf)

1911 census shows John (42) and Thomas (40) living with their parents in Old Town, Broxburn.

## Third great-grandparents

### Edward Byrne and unknown

No records.

### Thomas Mulhall and Bridget Merrigan

No records.

### John Campbell and Catherine Fitzgerald (c.1830-1900)

- [CF death certificate](1920_death_catherine_fitzgerald.pdf)

### Denis McCaig/McKeag (c.1816-1864) and Mary McGarry (c.1814-1865)

- [1861 census](1861_census_denis_mckeag_mary_mcgarry.pdf)
- [DM death certificate](1864_death_denis_mccaig_dyer.pdf)
- [MM death certificate](1865_death_mary_mcgarry.pdf)

1861 census lists Denis and Mary as Irish born with 4 children born in Scotland.

### John Johnston (c.1810-1886) and Mabel Meechan (c.1825-1887)

- [1881 census](1881_census_john_johnston_mabel_meechan.pdf)
- [JJ death certificate](1886_death_john_johnston.pdf)
- [MM death certificate](1887_death_mabel_meechan.pdf)

Address (88 Greendykes Road) from 1881 census matches death certificate of John registered by his son Thomas in 1886. Also living at the address in 1881 are Phebla (Mabel), Elizabeth (aged 22), and Patrick Meechan (presumably relative of Mabel), all born in Ireland. Our surname traces back to this John Johnston. Apparently they moved back and forth between Ireland and Scotland working in the shale industry. 

## Fourth great-grandparents

### Patrick Fitzgerald and Catherine Fitzgerald

No records.

### Denis McCaig and Mary Logan

No records.

### Michael McGarry and Margaret Reynolds

No records.

### Patrick Meehan and Margaret Mourne
